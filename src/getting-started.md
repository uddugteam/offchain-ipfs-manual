# Getting Started

You can get up and running in about 15 minutes by:

- Running `offchain::ipfs` via the provided docker image
- Previewing the functionality via the [substrate-front-end-template]

> **Why a Docker image?**<br />[`offchain::ipfs`] is currently a well-maintained fork of
[paritytech/substrate]. Until we are ready to make an upstream PR, we are using a Docker image
for simplicity's sake.
